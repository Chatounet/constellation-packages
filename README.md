### Reporting Issues

Please report [packages specific issues here](https://github.com/myconstellation/constellation-packages/issues).

### How to add or update package ?

1. Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch
1. Write clean code
1. Pull request your code

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a
reference to all the issues that they address.

Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into
logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. After every
commit the test suite should be passing. Include documentation changes in the
same commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like `Closes #XXX`
or `Fixes #XXX`, which will automatically close the issue when merged.
